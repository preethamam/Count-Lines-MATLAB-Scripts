# Line Count Utility (MATLAB)
[![View Count lines in MATLAB scripts for project folder on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/182673-count-lines-in-matlab-scripts-for-project-folder) [![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=preethamam/Count-Lines-MATLAB-Scripts)
Overview
--------

This small MATLAB utility recursively counts code, comment and blank lines
across files in a folder (or for a supplied file list) and writes a plain-text
report named `lineCount.txt`.

Repository layout
-----------------

- `countLines.m` — Main function that scans files, classifies lines, and
  writes `lineCount.txt` (also contains the helper `parseFile` sub-function).
- `main.m` — Example runner that demonstrates how to call `countLines`.
- `lineCount.txt` — Example output generated by the utility.

Requirements
------------

- MATLAB (R2019b or later recommended for `arguments` validation).
- No additional toolboxes required.

Usage
-----

Call the function from the MATLAB command window, from a script, or use the
provided `main.m` example. Examples:

```matlab
% Count all .m files under a folder and write report to current folder
countLines('C:\path\to\project')

% Specify file types and an output directory
countLines('C:\path\to\project', {'.m', '.cpp'}, {}, 'C:\out')

% Provide an explicit list of files
countLines({'file1.m', 'file2.cpp'}, {'.m', '.cpp'})
```

Function signature
------------------

countLines(inputPath, fileTypes, ignoreFiles, saveDir)

- `inputPath` (char|string|cell): A folder path (to search recursively) or a
  cell array of file paths to analyze.
- `fileTypes` (cell): Cell array of extensions to include, e.g. `{'.m', '.cpp'}`.
  Default: `{'.m'}`.
- `ignoreFiles` (cell): Filenames (name+ext) to ignore. Default: `{}`.
- `saveDir` (char|string): Directory where `lineCount.txt` will be written.
  Default: current working directory.

Output
------

`lineCount.txt` contains one line per file with counts and a grand total
section. Example layout:

```
File : Code | Comments | Blank | Total
------------------------------------------------------
C:\path\to\file1.m : 100 | 20 | 10 | 130

Grand Totals:
Code     : 100
Comments : 20
Blank    : 10
Total    : 130
```

Heuristics and limitations
--------------------------

- Lines beginning with `%` (MATLAB) or `//` (C/C++) are considered comment
  lines.
- Block comments using `/* ... */` are tracked and counted as comment lines.
- Inline comments on the same line as code are counted as code lines.
- The function uses simple heuristics and may misclassify complex constructs.

Extending the utility
---------------------

- To add support for additional file types, provide their extensions in
  `fileTypes`.
- To change classification behavior (for example, to treat inline comments
  differently), edit the `parseFile` sub-function inside `countLines.m`.
- To change output format (CSV, JSON), modify the write section in
  `countLines.m` where `lineCount.txt` is created.
